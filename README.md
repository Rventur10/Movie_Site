# Movie_Site
Movie Search Site
After completing two projects in Python, I decided to transition to Java. Although I’ve always heard mixed reviews about Java, I felt it was time to embrace the challenge and learn the language. To push myself further, I chose to create a movie search site that includes reviews, combining my passion for film with programming.

Features
	Movie Search: Users can search for movies using an API.
	Reviews: Users can view and submit reviews for various films.

Technologies Used
	API Integration: This is my first experience using an API (TheMovieDatabase).
	Database: I’m using MongoDB to store movie data and user reviews from IMDB.
	
Current Challenges
	I’m currently working on connecting to MongoDB, as I’m facing issues retrieving data from the database. I don’t have a clear understanding of the 	problem yet, but that's future to figure out.!

I plan to update this file as the project evolves. Thank you for reading!
